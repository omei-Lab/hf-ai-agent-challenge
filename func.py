	Read the following question carefully and classify it into exactly one of the following categories:

	- 'reverse': The question is written backwards or involves reading text in reverse.
	- 'logic': The question involves logical reasoning, abstract thinking, or puzzles (e.g., tables, sets, conditions).
	- 'web': The question asks about real-world entities (such as people, shows, dates, locations) that typically require external lookup or search.
	- 'others': The question is simple or doesn't fit the above types.

	Examples:

	Q: "If you write the word 'left' backwards, can you read this sentence?"
	A: reverse

	Q: "Given a set and an operation table, find counterexamples to commutativity."
	A: logic

	Q: "Who played the role of X in the Polish version of Y?"
	A: web

	Q: "How old is Alice?"
	A: others

	Important instructions:
	- Only answer with one lowercase word: reverse, logic, web, or others.
	- Avoid overthinking. If any real-world entity (person, media, place, date) is mentioned, itâ€™s most likely 'web'.

	Now classify the following question:
